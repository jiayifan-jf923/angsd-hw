# A RNA-seq Analysis of EWSR1::WT1‑Dependent Gene‑Expression Programs in Desmoplastic Small‑Round‑Cell Tumor (DSRCT) Cells

This is the repository for ANGSD course project. The project is about the RNA-seq analysis of EWSR1::WT1 knock-down in desmoplastic small round-cell tumour (DSRCT) cells (GEO:[GSE252051](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE252051)). The goal is to show that depletion of the fusion oncoprotein, EWSR1::WT1, up-regulates immune pathways and suppresses cell-cycle programmes.
